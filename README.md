# Resources
For anyone who wants to make their own interpreter, I found the following resources particularly useful.
* [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy.html)
* [Programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
* [Scheme (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29)
